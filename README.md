Today, I tried to find some junior developers and attempted to interview them. However, our boss informed us that we have problems with communication and socialization, and that conducting interviews is not the priority at the moment. Instead, we need to work on improving these specific skills.

Afterward, our coworker suggested that we set milestones. Once we've achieved these milestones, I will attempt to contact some individuals with expertise in Google Analytics to inquire about their availability.
